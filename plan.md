# Plan: FoundationModelsAgents — Claude-style sub-agents for Foundation Models

A Swift package that loads [Claude Code sub-agent](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)
definition files from stacked directories and exposes them to Apple's
[Foundation Models framework](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2026/241/) through
**one tool** — `AgentsTool` — with a scheduler that runs **many agents in parallel** for
multi-tasking. Models come from [`../FoundationModelsRouter`](../FoundationModelsRouter/plan.md);
the generic stacked-folder machinery comes from
[`../FoundationModelsSkills`](../FoundationModelsSkills/plan.md).
**Primary target: macOS, on-device.**

---

## 1. Guiding principles

- **An agent is just a tool — no special case.** In an FM session, sub-agents are reached
  through one `FoundationModels.Tool` — `AgentsTool` (**list / run / start / check / send /
  cancel**).
  The framework has no agents concept; we add a *tool*, not a new primitive. This mirrors
  Claude Code, where delegation happens through the `Agent` (né `Task`) tool. But it is a
  **special tool result**: every action returns a typed `AgentEvent` that lands in the
  calling session's transcript as a structured segment (§8.2), so agent starts/stops are
  first-class entries in the caller's record, not prose.
- **One session system, one recording system.** An agent is a *utility that drives
  activity in a session*. Every run is a **Router session** — a child in the Router's
  lineage-nested recording tree — so there is exactly one transcript model, one event
  vocabulary, and one thing to observe: **the session** (§7, §8.3, §9).
- **A sub-agent is a fresh, isolated session — a *routed* one.** Each run gets its own
  tool-capable `RoutedSession`: its own context, its own system prompt (the definition
  body), its own tool set, its own working directory. It sees only the task prompt the
  caller composed — never the parent's context (unless deliberately *forked*, §7). Only its
  **final text** returns to the caller.
- **Definition ≠ run ≠ session.** An `AgentDefinition` is authored data; an `AgentRun` is
  one delegated task — the unit of scheduling, cancellation, and UI — and it **drives**
  exactly one session, which is never vended (§7.1). The run's id **is** its session's id.
  One definition, many concurrent runs; follow-ups go through the run, whose session (and
  context) lives as long as the run handle.
- **Descriptions are the delegation contract.** Agent catalogs are small (unlike skills), so
  each agent's `name` + `description` are baked directly into the `AgentsTool` surface — the
  root model reads them to decide when and where to delegate. No separate search agent.
  (If a deployment's catalog ever outgrows the baked-in surface,
  [`../FoundationModelsMetadataRegistry`](../FoundationModelsMetadataRegistry/plan.md)
  is the ready-made opt-in — `MetadataSearcher<AgentListing>`; its plan reserves exactly
  that role and leaves the decision here. §10.)
- **Models are routed, never named.** A definition says *how much* model it wants
  (`standard` / `flash` / `inherit`), not *which* HF repo — the Router already solved
  machine-fit. Claude aliases (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`) map onto slots.
- **Parallel by admission, honest about the GPU.** An `AgentRunner` actor schedules runs
  under a fair FIFO admission gate (`maxConcurrentAgents`). Runs genuinely interleave and
  runs on *different* slots (standard vs flash) genuinely overlap — but generation on one
  resident model is serialized by the Router's per-model gate, and we say so rather than
  pretend otherwise.
- **Reuse the stack, don't refork it.** `FrontmatterDocument` + `FolderStack` (Skills
  layers 1–2) parse and stack the definition files; `SkillsRegistry` powers the `skills:`
  preload. The Skills plan already anticipated this ("the same stack also serves agents");
  this package **is** that consumer (see §10 for the cross-repo consequences).
- **macOS-first, on-device.** iOS is a graceful "unavailable" stub.

## 2. Layered architecture

```
┌─ Layer 4  FM adapter (agents) ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   AgentsTool — one core FoundationModels.Tool: list / run / start /        │
│                check / send / cancel                                       │
│   AgentRunner — actor: parallel runs, fair admission, cancellation         │
│   AgentRun — drives ONE RoutedSession (run id = session id); state, result │
│   AgentActivity — @Observable per-profile dashboard (runs + slot lanes)    │
├─ Layer 3  AgentRegistry  (domain validation + semantics) ──────────────────┤

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     Execution substrate: FoundationModelsRouter — LanguageModelProfile slots
     (.standard / .flash), resident models, per-model serial gate, recording
```

- Layers 1–2 are **imported from `FoundationModelsSkills`**, not reimplemented. One
  generalization is required there: agents are **flat `*.md` files scanned recursively**
  (Claude layout), not `name/SKILL.md` directories — the `EntryKind` must support a
  file-shaped entry (§10).
- **`AgentRegistry`** (Layer 3, the source of truth) — wraps a `FolderStack<Agent>`; adds
  Claude-compatible validation (§4), identity + precedence (§3), tool-list resolution (§5),
  model mapping (§6), and skills preload (§5). Reloadable; publishes refreshed metadata.
  **Model-free**: the registry is pure files + validation; the Router never enters here
  (§6's mapping produces a *slot name*, not a model).
- **FM adapter** (Layer 4) — `AgentsTool`, `AgentRunner`, `AgentRun`, all reading the
  registry and executing over Router-vended models. **The Router enters exactly once,
  through `AgentEnvironment.profile`** — a Router-resolved `LanguageModelProfile` (§7, §12);
  everything model-shaped flows from that one handle.

## 3. Identity, locations & precedence

- **`name` frontmatter = canonical id** (Claude rule: identity comes from `name`, the
  filename doesn't have to match). Validated: lowercase letters and hyphens. This differs
  deliberately from Skills' directory-name identity — agents are single files and we follow
  the Claude spec for them.
- **Roots are caller-supplied, ordered low → high precedence**, e.g.
  `[~/.claude/agents, <project>/.claude/agents]` — user-wide first, project overrides.
  Override is **full replace by `name`** up the stack (same rule as Skills).
- Each root is scanned **recursively**; subdirectories organize, they don't namespace
  (matching Claude's project/user scan behavior).
- **Duplicate `name` within one root** ⇒ one wins deterministically (last in stable sort
  order) and a **diagnostic** is emitted — mirroring Claude's `/doctor` duplicate report.
- The **file watcher** applies add/remove/edit across every root; the registry rebuilds and
  publishes refreshed metadata (Claude requires a restart — we do better because the
  FolderStack already watches).

## 4. Definition format — Claude-compatible subset

One `.md` file: YAML frontmatter + body. **The body is the sub-agent's system prompt**,
verbatim — it is *not* rendered through the skills argument/shell/Stencil pipeline (a system
prompt is authored static text; the dynamic part of a run is the task prompt). Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices. Use proactively after changes.
tools: Read, Grep
model: flash
---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
```

Field support tiers — parse everything, act on tier 1, carry tier 2 as data, diagnose tier 3:

| Tier | Fields | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — enforced** | `name`, `description` (required); `tools`, `disallowedTools`; `model`; `skills`; `maxTurns`; `background` | Full semantics (§5–§7) |
| **2 — data only** | `color`, plus all unrecognized `metadata`-style keys | Exposed on `AgentListing` for hosts/UI; no behavior |
| **3 — unsupported** | `permissionMode`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `memory`, `effort`, `isolation`, `initialPrompt` | Parsed, surfaced as a **diagnostic** ("field X is not supported by FoundationModelsAgents"), otherwise ignored — a Claude-authored file still loads |

`description` is the delegation contract (injected into the `AgentsTool` surface) — the
"use proactively" convention works here exactly as in Claude Code, because the root model
reads the same words.

## 5. Tools & skills for a sub-agent

- **`ToolCatalog`** — the host registers the universe of available tools by name:
  `name → any FoundationModels.Tool` (factories, so each run gets fresh instances where a
  tool is stateful). The `SkillsTool` from FoundationModelsSkills is just another catalog
  entry.
- **Resolution (Claude semantics):** omit `tools` ⇒ inherit the **whole catalog**;
  `disallowedTools` is applied first (removed from inherited or specified list), then
  `tools` is resolved against the remainder; a tool named in both is removed. Unknown tool
  names ⇒ diagnostic, skipped.
- **No nested agents in v1.** The `AgentsTool` is never placed in a sub-agent's tool set,
  and a definition listing it draws a diagnostic. (Claude allows depth 5; we start at 1 —
  a depth-limited nesting option is a clean later extension.)
- **`skills:` preload — a formal Skills dependency.** The environment carries a
  `SkillsRegistry` (non-optional; an empty registry is fine), and each listed skill's
  **rendered body** is appended to the sub-agent's instructions at run start (full content,
  not just the description — Claude's `skills` semantics). Missing or
  `disable-model-invocation` skills are skipped with a diagnostic. This is the second half
  of the Skills dependency: layers 1–2 for the definition stack (§2), `SkillsRegistry` for
  preload (§10).
- **`maxTurns`** — FM's session runs its tool loop inside one `respond` call, so we enforce
  the bound structurally: every tool handed to the run is wrapped in a **counting decorator**;
  when the count crosses `maxTurns` the run is cancelled and reports
  `.failed(hitMaxTurns)`. Best-effort but real — no tool call escapes the wrapper.

## 6. Model mapping — frontmatter → Router slot

A resolved `LanguageModelProfile` supplies the models; the definition picks a slot:

| `model:` value | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| *(omitted)* / `inherit` | the environment's **default slot** (the slot backing the root session; configured on `AgentEnvironment`) |
| `standard` *(ours, canonical)* | `profile.standard` |
| `flash` *(ours, canonical)* | `profile.flash` |
| `opus`, `sonnet`, `fable` *(Claude aliases)* | `profile.standard` |
| `haiku` *(Claude alias)* | `profile.flash` |
| full model id (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`, an HF repo) | **diagnostic; falls back to `inherit`** — picking repos is the Router's job, not a definition's |

The alias table lives in a `ModelMapping` value (default above, host-overridable), so a
Claude-authored agent file runs unmodified while our canonical vocabulary stays
slot-shaped.

## 7. Execution — one run drives one routed session

`AgentRun` is one delegated task:

1. **Resolve** the agent from the live registry (stale name ⇒ error carrying the current
   listing, same backstop pattern as `SkillsTool.call`).
2. **Assemble** instructions = definition body + rendered `skills:` preloads; tools = §5
   resolution, each wrapped in the counting decorator; model = §6 slot.
3. **Spawn** a **tool-capable `RoutedSession`** over the slot's resident model (§10's Router
   growth) with the assembled instructions and tools, and submit the caller's task prompt.
   The FM tool loop (via the `MLXLanguageModel` interop) runs *inside* the session's
   recorded chokepoint — every prompt, response, `toolCall`, and `toolOutput` is a recorded
   session event.
4. **Return** the session's final text as the run's result. Tool traffic, intermediate
   turns, and context stay inside the run.

**Agent runs are Router sessions — not a parallel session system.** The session is the unit
of recording, lineage, residency, and observation; the agent is a utility that drives
activity in it:

- **Lineage is delegation.** A run started from a routed calling session is a **child
  session** — `parentId` = the caller, recording directory nested under the caller's — so
  the Router's on-disk session tree *is* the delegation tree. A host-driven run with no
  calling session is a root session under the Router.
- **Two child flavors.** **`spawn`** — fresh context: own instructions (the agent body),
  own tools, empty cache — the named-agent case. **`fork`** — inherits the caller's context
  and prefilled KV prefix — Claude's fork-the-conversation case, which also recovers KV
  prefix reuse for template fan-outs. Both are children in one tree; both queue at the
  Router's admission gate.
- **Recording is structural, once.** Sessions are born holding the Router's recorder; the
  bracketed chokepoint sees the whole tool loop. No agents-side recording system exists (§9).

This requires the Router to grow (§10): tool-capable sessions, a `spawn` sibling to
`fork()`, and a live event tap on the recorder. *(Engineering risk: reconciling the
session-owned KV cache with an FM-driven tool loop. Worst case, tool-capable sessions
delegate cache management to FM and lose `fork()` KV reuse on those sessions — while
recording, lineage, residency, and the gates still unify. Verify against the shipping
WWDC26 SDK.)*

Every run's session has the Router's **`workingDirectory`** semantics — defaults to its
recording directory, overridable per run — for cooperative filesystem isolation between
concurrent agents.

### 7.1 Agents ↔ runs ↔ sessions — the object model

Three nouns, deliberately distinct — the Router's authored/resolved split, applied to agents:

```
AgentDefinition  (authored file)     static data; no runtime state; one per name
      │  runner.start(name, prompt)
      ▼
AgentRun  (id = session id)          ONE delegated task — the unit of scheduling,
      │  drives; never vends         cancellation, and UI
      ▼
RoutedSession  (internal)            the run's engine IN the Router's session and
                                     recording tree; born and released with its run
```

- **One definition, many runs.** Concurrent runs of the same agent are fully independent —
  separate sessions, contexts, working directories, transcripts. The run id **is the
  session id** — one ULID names the run in `check`/`send`/`cancel`, the activity row, and
  the session's transcript directory in the Router tree.
- **A run drives exactly one session** for its whole life, and the session is **never
  vended** — the Router's "no side door" rule holds. Everything crosses the run: prompts
  in, final text out; the session itself is what gets recorded and observed (§8.3, §9).
- **Residency is structural.** A `RoutedSession` retains its profile — the Router's own
  invariant — so resident models cannot be evicted mid-run, with nothing re-established at
  the agents layer.
- **Runs are resumable while retained.** Because the run keeps its session, a follow-up
  continues the same context after `finished` — `run.send(_:)` from Swift, the `send(runId,
  prompt)` action from the model (Claude's resume semantics: a new invocation is fresh;
  resuming a run keeps its full history). Releasing the run releases the session and its
  context; a released or cancelled run's id draws a clear "gone" error, not a silent
  restart.
- **Root sessions are peers, not parents.** The runner exists independently of any root
  session; several root sessions — or plain host code — can share one runner. The
  `AgentsTool` is just a view of the runner from inside a session, and a run never holds a
  reference back to whoever started it.

## 8. Parallelism — the scheduler

**`AgentRunner`** (actor) owns every `AgentRun`:

- **Fair FIFO admission** — at most `maxConcurrentAgents` runs in flight; excess `start`s
  queue on a fair async semaphore (the same primitive the Router uses for forks and its
  per-model serial gate).
- **Two invocation styles through `AgentsTool`:**
  - **`run(agent, prompt)`** — *foreground*: the tool call awaits completion and returns the
    final text. Parallelism still happens when the root model emits **several `run` calls in
    one turn** — FM executes parallel tool calls concurrently. *(Confirm parallel tool-call
    execution against the shipping WWDC26 SDK — decision #12.)*
  - **`start(agent, prompt)` → runId; `check(runId)`; `send(runId, prompt)`;
    `cancel(runId)`** — *background*: the tool returns immediately with a ULID run id; the
    root keeps working and polls `check`, which reports state and, when finished, the final
    text. `send` continues a retained run's session with a follow-up (§7.1). A definition
    with `background: true` is *always* dispatched this way, even via `run`.
- **Host-driven fan-out** needs no root session at all: `runner.start(_:prompt:)` from
  Swift returns an `AgentRun` handle to await — many handles, structured concurrency,
  `TaskGroup`-friendly.
- **Cancellation** is structured: cancelling an `AgentRun` cancels its session's Swift task;
  `cancel(runId)` does it from the model side; runner teardown cancels everything.
- **Observability** — the runner publishes an `@MainActor @Observable` **`AgentActivity`**
  for direct SwiftUI binding — the `ResolutionProgress` pattern, applied to the fleet (§8.1).
- **Honesty clause:** concurrent runs on the *same* slot interleave at the Router's
  per-model serial gate (one generation at a time per resident model); true overlap comes
  from spreading agents across `standard` and `flash`. The scheduler makes multitasking
  *correct and bounded*; the hardware decides how simultaneous it is.

### 8.1 SwiftUI observability — per profile

A runner is bound to **one resolved `LanguageModelProfile`** (the Router's
one-active-profile rule), so per-runner **is** per-profile: `runner.activity` is that
profile's agent dashboard. It is `@MainActor @Observable`, bound straight into SwiftUI:

```swift
@MainActor @Observable
final class AgentActivity {
  let profileName: String                  // the resolved profile this fleet runs on
  var runs: [AgentRunSnapshot] = []        // live + recently finished, newest first
  var lanes: [ModelSlot: SlotLane] = [:]   // the per-model serial gates, visualized
}

struct AgentRunSnapshot: Identifiable, Sendable {
  let id: ULID                             // run id — the row identity
  let agent: String                        // definition name
  let color: AgentColor?                   // frontmatter `color:` — consumed here
  let slot: ModelSlot
  var state: AgentRunState                 // queued → running → finished/failed/cancelled
  var startedAt: Date?; var finishedAt: Date?
  var tokensIn: Int; var tokensOut: Int    // as reported by the FM session
  var lastEvent: String?                   // "calling tool grep…" — fed live by §8.3
}

struct SlotLane: Sendable {                // one resident model = one serial lane
  var generating: ULID?                    // the run holding the gate right now
  var queued: [ULID]                       // waiting on this slot, FIFO
}
```

- **Lanes make the honesty clause visible.** Each slot's serial gate is drawn as a lane —
  one run generating, the rest queued behind it — so the UI shows *why* a run is waiting
  instead of an unexplained spinner.
- The `color:` frontmatter field (tier 2, data-only in the registry) is **consumed here**:
  each agent gets its stable badge color in the run list — exactly its Claude Code role.
- Snapshots are value types published on the main actor after each state transition and
  turn; SwiftUI list diffing stays cheap, and a host can keep old snapshots as history.
- **Profiles over an app's lifetime are sequential** (release one, resolve the next — the
  Router rule), so runners are too: one runner, one profile, one `AgentActivity`. A
  profile-switching UI is two dashboards in succession, not one merged view.

### 8.2 Agent events in the calling session's transcript

The agent system is just a tool — but its result is a **special tool result**. Every
`AgentsTool` action returns a **typed `AgentEvent`**, never prose:

```swift
@Generable enum AgentEvent {           // the tool's output type — structured, not text
  case started(runId: ULID, agent: String, slot: ModelSlot)
  case running(runId: ULID, lastEvent: String?)
  case finished(runId: ULID, result: String)
  case failed(runId: ULID, reason: String)
  case sent(runId: ULID)               // follow-up accepted; result via a later check
  case cancelled(runId: ULID)
  case gone(runId: ULID)               // released/unknown id — §7.1's clear error
}
```

FoundationModels records every tool call and its output as transcript entries built from
**segments**, so these events land in the calling session's `Transcript` as **structured
segments** — the custom-segment pattern — rather than dissolving into a text blob:

- **Lifecycle is first-class in the caller's transcript.** `start` writes a `started`
  segment (runId, agent, slot) at the moment of delegation; the `check` that harvests the
  outcome writes `finished`/`failed` (a foreground `run` returns `finished` directly).
  Replaying the calling transcript reconstructs the
  delegation timeline — who was started, when, on what, and how each ended — without
  parsing prose. A transcript UI renders agent chips/timeline straight from the segments.
- **The model reads the same structure.** Tool output is model-visible, so the root model
  sees unambiguous typed state (`running` vs `finished(result:)`) instead of guessing from
  wording — which is what makes `check`-based multitasking reliable.
- **Honesty about timing:** a tool can only write to the transcript inside its own call, so
  a *background* run's completion appears in the caller's transcript at the harvesting
  `check` — the live, continuous view is `AgentActivity` (§8.1); the calling transcript
  records the **interaction points**. A finished run's final text enters the caller's
  context exactly once, as that harvesting `finished` event's `result` (`sent` deliberately
  carries none — a follow-up's outcome arrives via its own later `check`).
- **The records are one tree.** The runId in the caller's `started` segment *is* the
  agent's session id, and that session's `transcript.jsonl` is nested under the caller's in
  the Router tree (§9) — caller timeline and sub-agent detail join by lineage, not by
  side-band correlation.
- *(Confirm against the shipping WWDC26 SDK how structured tool output is represented in
  `Transcript` segments — same verification item as Skills decision #18.)*

### 8.3 Live progress — observe the session

**The thing to observe is the session.** Because agent runs are routed sessions (§7),
every prompt, response, sub-tool call, and tool output already flows through the Router's
recorder chokepoint as a typed, totally-ordered event (`seq`/`ts`, the schema in §9).
Progress is that same stream, delivered live:

- **One tap: the recorder.** The Router grows a live event surface (§10) — each session
  event is published as it is appended. `AgentRun.events: AsyncStream<TranscriptEvent>` is
  the run's session filtered out of that feed, finishing at terminal state; `AgentActivity`
  (§8.1) is the feed folded on the main actor — `lastEvent` is the latest `toolCall`, token
  counts come from the recorded turn events. One vocabulary, no duplicate stream.
- **The §5 decorator stays for enforcement, not eventing.** `maxTurns` counting rides the
  wrapped tools; tool events reach observers through the recorder like everything else.
- **The Router's role, stated exactly:** it supplies the resident model, the per-model
  serial gate (why §8.1's `lanes` are truthful), the session itself, **and the event
  feed** — because the session *is* a Router session. Nothing about progress lives outside
  the session record model.

## 9. Recording & diagnostics

- **One recording system: the Router's.** An agent run's transcript is its session's
  `transcript.jsonl` in the Router's lineage-nested tree
  (`recordings/<routerId>/<caller…>/<sessionId>/`) — spawned/forked runs nest under their
  calling session; host-driven runs are roots. Events carry the Router's provenance schema
  (`{ routerId, sessionId, parentId, slot, model, seq, ts, kind:
  "session"|"prompt"|"response"|"toolCall"|"toolOutput", … }`); the agents package **adds
  only metadata** — the agent `name` stamped on the session's opening event — so "which
  agent was this" is answerable from the record. Merged `**/transcript.jsonl` ordering,
  `.jsonl`/`.inMemory`/`.none` sinks, redaction levels: all inherited from the Router, none
  re-implemented.
- **Diagnostics are data:** the registry exposes `[AgentDiagnostic]` (duplicate names,
  invalid frontmatter, unsupported fields, unknown tools/skills, unmappable models) so a
  host can render a doctor view; nothing valid is blocked by something invalid next to it.

## 10. Cross-repo prerequisites

This plan **supersedes** two assumptions in the sibling plans:

1. **FoundationModelsSkills** — a **formal, two-part dependency**. (a) Its decision #17 /
   milestone M7 originally placed the future `AgentRegistry` *inside* the Skills target; it
   now lives **here** instead, and the Skills plan has been updated to match (its decisions
   #17 and #19, and M1): Skills exports `FrontmatterDocument` and `FolderStack` as public
   API, and `FolderStack`'s `EntryKind` supports **file-shaped entries** (flat `*.md`,
   recursive scan) alongside directory-shaped ones (`name/SKILL.md`). (b) The `skills:`
   preload capacity (§5) consumes `SkillsRegistry` — Skills' Layer 3 — directly.
   Sequencing: our M1 needs Skills M1; our M2 needs Skills M1–M2; our M6's preload needs
   Skills M3 (`SkillsRegistry`). (c) Skills' search path now rides
   `../FoundationModelsMetadataRegistry` (Skills decision #26), and Skills ships as a
   single target (its #17) — so depending on Skills **transitively carries
   MetadataRegistry and the Router**. Accepted, not a problem: we already require the
   Router directly (item 2 below, §2), the platform floors match (macOS 27+), and no
   lightweight split of Skills' layers is planned or wanted.
2. **FoundationModelsRouter** — the biggest supersession: agent runs are **routed
   sessions**, so the Router grows three things. (a) **Tool-capable sessions** —
   `makeSession(tools:instructions:…)` runs the FM interop tool loop (`MLXLanguageModel`)
   *inside* the recorded chokepoint, emitting the `toolCall`/`toolOutput` events its
   transcript schema already defines. (b) **`spawn`** — a child-session primitive beside
   `fork()`: lineage (`parentId`, nested recording directory) with a *fresh* cache and its
   own instructions/tools, for fresh-context agents. (c) A **live recorder tap** — an
   observable/streaming surface over appended events, feeding §8.3. Its plan's "interop
   available but not load-bearing" is superseded: the interop is load-bearing and lives
   *inside* `RoutedSession`. *(Risk: session-owned KV vs an FM-driven tool loop — §7.)*

Packaging: **single SwiftPM library target `FoundationModelsAgents`**, depending on
`FoundationModelsRouter` and `FoundationModelsSkills` (both as local/sibling packages during
development); `./Examples` executables are additional targets in the same package (§13).
macOS 27+, Swift 6.1 tools, same platform commitment as the Router — no fallback paths.

## 11. Resolved decisions

1. **FM entry point → one `AgentsTool`** with **list / run / start / check / send / cancel**
   actions, on core `FoundationModels.Tool` — the Skills single-tool pattern.
2. **Identity → frontmatter `name`** (Claude rule; agents are single files), validated
   lowercase+hyphens; full-replace override by name up the stack; duplicate-in-root ⇒
   diagnostic.
3. **Format → Claude-compatible subset**, three tiers: enforced (`name`, `description`,
   `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `model`, `skills`, `maxTurns`, `background`), data-only
   (`color`, unknown keys), diagnosed-unsupported (`permissionMode`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`,
   `memory`, `effort`, `isolation`, `initialPrompt`).
4. **Body → literal system prompt.** No argument/shell/Stencil rendering; the dynamic input
   is the task prompt.
5. **Models → slot-mapped**: `standard` / `flash` / `inherit` canonical; Claude aliases map
   (`opus`/`sonnet`/`fable` → standard, `haiku` → flash) via an overridable `ModelMapping`;
   literal model ids draw a diagnostic and fall back to `inherit`.
6. **Execution → tool-capable `RoutedSession`s.** Agent runs are Router sessions — `spawn`
   for fresh-context named agents, `fork` for context-inheriting ones — with the FM tool
   loop (`MLXLanguageModel`) running *inside* the recorded chokepoint. One session system;
   recording, lineage, residency, and the gates are inherited, and `fork` recovers KV
   prefix reuse. *(Supersedes the earlier native-`LanguageModelSession` choice; Router
   growth in §10; KV-vs-FM-loop risk in §7.)*
7. **Tools → host `ToolCatalog`**; omit = inherit all; `disallowedTools` then `tools`
   (Claude order); unknown names diagnosed. No nested agents in v1.
8. **`skills:` preload → rendered bodies appended to instructions** at run start, via the
   environment's `SkillsRegistry` — a **formal Skills dependency**, non-optional (an empty
   registry is fine; missing skills are diagnostics). Full content, Claude semantics.
9. **`maxTurns` → counting tool decorator**; crossing the bound cancels the run.
10. **Parallelism → `AgentRunner` actor** with fair FIFO admission (`maxConcurrentAgents`),
    structured cancellation, background runs by id, `@Observable AgentActivity` for UI.
    Per-model serialization acknowledged, not hidden.
11. **Recording → the Router's, unchanged** (§9). A run's transcript is its session's
    `transcript.jsonl` in the Router's lineage tree, nested under its caller; the agents
    package adds only the agent-name stamp on the opening event. No parallel recording
    system.
12. **Foreground parallel `run` relies on FM parallel tool-call execution.** *(Confirm
    against the shipping WWDC26 SDK; if tool calls execute serially, the `start`/`check`
    path is the parallel primitive and `run` stays correct, just sequential.)*
13. **Layer reuse → depend on FoundationModelsSkills** for `FrontmatterDocument` +
    `FolderStack` (with the file-entry generalization) — superseding Skills decision #17's
    same-target `AgentRegistry`.
14. **Packaging → one package**: a single library target plus `./Examples`
    executable/app targets in the same `Package.swift` (§13) — no nested example
    package. macOS 27+ / Swift 6.1, sibling-package dependencies on Router and Skills;
    example-only dependencies join the shared manifest.
15. **Object model → definition ≠ run ≠ session** (§7.1). `AgentDefinition` is data;
    `AgentRun` is the unit of scheduling/cancellation/UI and **drives exactly one
    never-vended routed session** — run id = session id; residency is the session's own
    Router invariant. Runs are **resumable while retained** — `run.send(_:)` / the `send`
    action continue the same context; release frees session and context.
16. **Observability → per-profile `AgentActivity`** (`@MainActor @Observable`, §8.1): one
    runner per resolved profile, run snapshots + per-slot **lanes** that visualize the
    serial gates; the `color:` field is consumed here for stable agent badges. Sequential
    profiles ⇒ sequential runners ⇒ one dashboard each.
17. **Calling-transcript events → typed `AgentEvent` tool output** (§8.2). The agent system
    is just a tool, but its result is a *special tool result*: every action returns a
    `@Generable AgentEvent` (`started` / `running` / `finished` / `failed` / `sent` /
    `cancelled` / `gone`) that lands in the calling session's `Transcript` as a structured
    segment — lifecycle first-class in the caller's record, model-visible, UI-renderable.
    Background completions surface at the harvesting `check`; live state is
    `AgentActivity`'s job. *(Confirm segment representation against the shipping WWDC26
    SDK.)*
18. **Router enters through the environment; progress is the session's record stream**
    (§2, §8.3). The registry is model-free; the Router's single entry point is
    `AgentEnvironment.profile`. Because runs are Router sessions, the live event feed *is*
    the recorder's stream — surfaced as `AgentRun.events: AsyncStream<TranscriptEvent>` and
    folded into `AgentActivity`; the §5 decorator remains for `maxTurns` enforcement only.

## 12. Public API sketch (illustrative)

```swift
// Layer 3 — stacked, watched, validated definitions. Pure files: NO Router here.
let agents = try AgentRegistry(
  roots: [userAgentsURL, projectAgentsURL],   // low → high; full-replace by name
  watch: true
)
agents.diagnostics                             // [AgentDiagnostic] — doctor view

// Models come from the Router — resolve once, share everywhere (Router plan):
let router  = Router()                         // FoundationModelsRouter
let profile = try await router.resolve(coding, reporting: progress)

// The execution environment — the Router enters HERE, via its resolved profile:
let env = AgentEnvironment(
  profile: profile,                            // Router-resolved LanguageModelProfile
  defaultSlot: .flash,                         // what `inherit` means here
  modelMapping: .default,                      // Claude aliases → slots
  tools: catalog,                              // ToolCatalog: name → Tool factory
  skills: skillsRegistry,                      // SkillsRegistry — `skills:` preload (may be empty)
  maxConcurrentAgents: 4                       // recordings live with the Router (§9)
)
let runner = AgentRunner(registry: agents, environment: env)

// Host-driven fan-out — root sessions under the Router; no calling session:
let run = try await runner.start("code-reviewer", prompt: "Review:\n\(diff)")
Task {                                         // live in-flight progress (§8.3):
  for await event in run.events { … }          // the session's TranscriptEvents, live
}
let report = try await run.result()            // final text; run.state observable
let more   = try await run.send("Now check the tests too")   // same session, same context
// Many at once, bounded by admission:
async let a = runner.start("code-reviewer", prompt: p1).result()
async let b = runner.start("test-writer",   prompt: p2).result()

// Layer 4 — model-driven delegation from a root session:
let agentsTool = AgentsTool.builder(runner: runner)
  .actions([.list, .run, .start, .check, .send, .cancel])
  .build()
let root = LanguageModelSession(
  tools: [agentsTool, skillsTool.tool],
  instructions: Instructions { "…base instructions…" }
)
// The root model now sees each agent's name + description and delegates:
// run("code-reviewer", "Review the diff …") → sub-agent's final text as tool output.

// Per-profile fleet observability for SwiftUI (§8.1):
@State var activity = runner.activity          // @MainActor @Observable AgentActivity
// activity.runs → rows; activity.lanes[.standard] → who's generating vs queued
```

Core types: `AgentDefinition` (parsed file), `AgentListing` (metadata view: name,
description, slot, tools, color, provenance), `AgentRegistry`, `AgentEnvironment`,
`ToolCatalog`, `ModelMapping`, `AgentsTool` + its `AgentEvent` output (§8.2),
`AgentRunner` (actor), `AgentRun` (handle: `id: ULID` — the session id, `state`, `events`
— a live stream of the session's Router `TranscriptEvent`s (§8.3), `result()`, `send(_:)`,
`cancel()`), `AgentRunState` (`queued`, `running`, `finished(String)`,
`failed(AgentRunFailure)`, `cancelled`), `AgentRunFailure`, `AgentActivity`
(`@MainActor @Observable`; `AgentRunSnapshot`, `SlotLane`, `AgentColor` — §8.1),
`AgentDiagnostic`.

## 13. Examples — `./Examples`

Runnable examples are part of the deliverable — living documentation and the human-driven
twin of the gated integration suite (§15). `Examples/` holds **executable/app targets in
the root package** — declared in the main `Package.swift`, not a nested package — so one
`swift build` covers library and examples alike; example-only dependencies (e.g.
`swift-argument-parser`) simply join the manifest:

```
Examples/
  agents/                shared agent definitions — a REAL stacked root
    code-reviewer.md       flash slot; tools: Read, Grep
    test-writer.md         standard slot
    summarizer.md          background: true
  DelegateCLI/           model-driven delegation: a root session with AgentsTool —
                         list / run / start / check — typed AgentEvents landing in the
                         calling transcript (§8.2 made runnable)
  FanOut/                host-driven parallelism: runner.start × N across both slots,
                         structured-concurrency await; prints the honesty clause live
                         (same-slot runs queue, cross-slot runs overlap — §8), then
                         walks the Router recording tree it produced (§9)
  AgentDashboard/        SwiftUI app on AgentActivity: run rows with color badges,
                         slot lanes, live lastEvent fed by run.events (§8.1, §8.3)
```

- Each example is small, single-purpose, and reads top-to-bottom as the tutorial for one
  section of this plan — the §12 sketch, made real.
- **`agents/` is a genuine root**, passed to `AgentRegistry(roots:)` — the same files
  exercise discovery, precedence, and diagnostics, and the integration tests may reuse
  them as fixtures.
- **Examples arrive with their milestone, not after it** (§14): `DelegateCLI` lands with
  M4, `FanOut` and `AgentDashboard` with M5; M7 finishes them (README per example,
  recording-tree walk, doc pass).

## 14. Milestones

- **M1 — Definition parsing + validation.** `AgentDefinition` on `FrontmatterDocument`:
  frontmatter tiers, name validation, tool-list parsing, model mapping (pure). *(Needs
  Skills M1.)*
- **M2 — `AgentRegistry` on `FolderStack`.** Stacked roots, recursive file entries,
  full-replace precedence, duplicate diagnostics, watch/reload, `listing()`. *(Needs Skills
  M2 + the file-entry generalization.)*
- **M3 — Execution substrate (the Router growth).** Tool-capable routed sessions, `spawn`,
  live recorder tap (§10); one `AgentRun` end to end: instructions + resolved tools + slot
  → spawned routed session → final text. *(The heaviest cross-repo milestone.)*
- **M4 — `AgentsTool`.** list/run on core `FoundationModels.Tool`; typed `AgentEvent`
  output landing as structured segments in the calling transcript (§8.2); live-registry
  deref with stale-name backstop; delegation proven from a root session.
- **M5 — Scheduler + observability.** `AgentRunner` admission gate, background
  `start`/`check`/`send`/`cancel`, structured cancellation, resumable runs (§7.1); the
  recorder's live feed surfaced as `run.events` (§8.3) and folded into `AgentActivity`
  with run snapshots + slot lanes (§8.1); `background: true` routing.
- **M6 — Semantics fill-in.** `skills:` preload *(needs Skills M3 — `SkillsRegistry`)*,
  `disallowedTools` order, `maxTurns` decorator, model-mapping diagnostics,
  workingDirectory isolation.
- **M7 — Lineage + polish.** Agent-name stamping on session events, delegation-tree
  assertions over the Router recordings tree, diagnostics surface, docs; the `./Examples`
  finish line (§13) — per-example READMEs, recording-tree walk.

## 15. Testing

Unit-testable pieces (frontmatter tiers, identity/precedence, tool-list resolution, model
mapping, maxTurns decorator, scheduler admission/cancellation) take injected definitions and
**stub sessions** — no models, covered per milestone. Registry tests run against fixture
directory stacks; watcher tests against temp dirs.

A separate **gated integration suite** (Swift Testing, `.serialized`, opt-in env var —
the Router's pattern, tiny `mlx-community` models) proves: a definition file becomes a live
sub-agent; delegation from a root session round-trips (root → `AgentsTool.run` → sub-agent
tool use → final text back); two concurrent runs on different slots make progress
independently; `check`/`cancel` behave; a `send` follow-up continues a run's context;
`run.events` surfaces a sub-tool call *while the run is still in flight* (§8.3); the
calling session's transcript carries the run's `started`/`finished` structured segments
(§8.2); a spawned run's `transcript.jsonl` nests under its calling session in the Router
tree, its tool calls appear as recorded `toolCall`/`toolOutput` events, and the merged log
stays totally ordered by `(ts, seq)`.
